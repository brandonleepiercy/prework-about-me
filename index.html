      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 22 year old college graduate trying to become proficient in as many useful skills as possible, before my body begins to fail me./p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Jose, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a graduate of the YouTube Mechanic's Institute and I am constantly making modifications to my car in my spare time. Very soon I will be done overhauling various safety and performance aspects and the plan is to start racing competitively as soon as possible.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A job that allows me to be flexible with my other pursuits in life, while maintaining a sense of importance and accomplishment in society.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel that the majority of human discoveries left to be had lie in software. There are a finite number of materials and atomic combinations in the unviverse, but no limit on the human imagination. I want to learn the basic skills to get into software development both so I can secure my future, and explore possibilities to solve everyday problems through coding.</p>
